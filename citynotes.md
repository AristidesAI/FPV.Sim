Lets redo the city area with specific rules that dictate object placement and logic.

## Buildings:
  
  Buildings should never overlap, Each building should be seperate slightly to provide gaps for the player to fly through, make each gap wide enough that the players drone model can fly through. Each building should be a slightly different color and they should all have names like "waldorf" "ritz" like fancy hotels.  on top of the buildings each one should have different elements like air-conditioners, telescopes, helipads, antenna. Whenever you place a roof element on top a building, You need to also place a door box so people can get onto that roof logically. Each buildings windows should be slightly different size and color. 

  Add new building types, 
  - Petrol station, With a roof the player can loop
  - church, 
  - construction site, building in progress - add cranes and things for the player to fly around
  - mini park, A small park in the city area that has gates around it, and childs play equipment 


add a max of 2-3 of these and never place them next to each other, spread the buildings around, The buildings shouldnt overlap. 

The tallest building should be really tall compared to the second tallest. Have one building in the centre of town be the tallest, and make sure it has all glass windows all over it, Make it a really thin boxy tower like 111 West 57th Street in NYC.

## City Blocks:


 There should be city blocks like in new york, With big two way roads that have lanes described below, with small streets intersecting those larger roads. 

 the city should have 20X20 blocks in the city area enough to fit 2-3 of each new type of building, along with the super tower. 

 ensure each building is slightly different color.
  
 ## City Streets:

 there will be asphalt grey sidewalks with specs of different color and texture in a sidewalk square pattern. 
 
 In the Green Gap areas use the green floor plane with grass textures, Use all the different tree types, use 3D grass.  place all different types of trees in this green gap, But ensure that trees never overlap, and never touch the buildings. The trees should brighten up the area. 

 Do not place safety cones in the city area, 
 Instead place: 
 
 Street lights, - only on the sidewalk with the light directed at the road area, Never touch buildings 
 Rubbish Bins,  - only on the sidewalk and green gap
 advertisments, - on buildings without windows
 street signs, - with garbled words on them, allow the player to fly through the gap between the street sign and the road 
 

### the order of the sidewalk on each side:

  Building
  Sidewalk (grey color)
  Green Gap (Green Floor Plane)
  Road (left)
  Road barrier
  Road (right)
  Green Gap (Green Floor Plane)
  Sidewalk (grey color)
  Building

  ### For smaller streets:

  Building
  Sidewalk
  Green Gap
